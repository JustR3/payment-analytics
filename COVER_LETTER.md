# Cover Letter - Data Analyst, Finance & Customer Payments

Dear Proton Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Data Analyst – Finance & Customer Payments position at Proton. As someone who believes deeply in privacy as a fundamental right, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Proton's mission while leveraging my expertise in payment analytics and subscription billing systems.

## Why This Project

To demonstrate my capabilities, I've built a comprehensive payment analytics pipeline analyzing subscription billing data—the exact type of work I would do at Proton. This project showcases my ability to:

- **Turn raw transaction data into actionable insights** for finance and product teams
- **Design production-ready data pipelines** using modern tools (Python, PostgreSQL, Metabase)
- **Identify revenue opportunities** through payment friction analysis
- **Communicate findings clearly** to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

## Key Project Highlights

### 1. Data Engineering Excellence
- Built a complete ETL pipeline processing 200 subscription transactions
- Cleaned, enriched, and loaded data into PostgreSQL with optimized indexes
- Documented all transformations with transparent, reproducible logic
- Used modern tools: UV for package management, Docker for infrastructure

### 2. Business Impact Analysis
Through this analysis, I identified **$624.95/month in MRR at risk** and discovered:
- **77.5% payment success rate** (below 85% industry benchmark)
- **62% of failures** stem from preventable issues (expired cards, insufficient funds)
- **Gateway errors** represent quick-win technical fixes worth $50-75/month
- **Processing time impact**: Transactions >10s have ~20% lower success rates

### 3. Actionable Recommendations
I didn't just report numbers—I provided a roadmap for improvement:
- **Immediate wins**: Fix gateway errors, implement card expiry notifications
- **Short-term initiatives**: Smart retry logic, payment method diversification
- **Strategic projects**: Predictive failure prevention, revenue recovery automation
- **Potential impact**: $400-525/month recovery ($5-6K annually)

### 4. Stakeholder-Ready Deliverables
- **Metabase dashboards** designed for different audiences (executive, operational, technical)
- **SQL query library** for ad-hoc analysis and reporting
- **Comprehensive documentation** explaining methodology and assumptions
- **One-command setup** (`./scripts/quickstart.sh`) for reproducibility

## Alignment with Proton's Needs

Your job description emphasizes:

✅ **"Analyse payment data to develop a full understanding of payment friction points"**  
→ My project dissects failure reasons, provider performance, and geographic patterns

✅ **"Design and visualise financial and payments KPIs tying revenue to specific product"**  
→ I created MRR-at-risk metrics, success rate tracking, and product-tier analysis

✅ **"Build data pipelines processing data from several sources"**  
→ My ETL pipeline demonstrates best practices: modularity, error handling, documentation

✅ **"Demonstrated ability to design financial dashboards (Metabase or similar)"**  
→ I've provided SQL examples and dashboard blueprints ready for Metabase implementation

✅ **"Solid understanding of subscription billing systems (Chargebee or similar)"**  
→ I applied SaaS metrics (MRR, churn, retention) and payment lifecycle concepts

## What I Bring to Proton

### Technical Skills
- **SQL & Python**: Proficient in data querying, transformation, and analysis
- **BI Tools**: Experience with Metabase, familiar with similar platforms
- **Payment Systems**: Understanding of payment processors, subscription billing, dunning
- **Data Quality**: Emphasis on documentation, validation, and reproducibility

### Business Acumen
- **SaaS Metrics**: Deep understanding of MRR, ARR, churn, LTV, CAC
- **Payment Analytics**: Knowledge of failure patterns, retry strategies, provider optimization
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Ability to translate data into actionable business recommendations
- **Privacy-First Mindset**: Aligned with Proton's values on user privacy and data protection

### Work Approach
- **Ownership**: I take end-to-end responsibility (data → insights → recommendations)
- **Clarity**: I document assumptions, explain methodology, and admit limitations
- **Impact-Oriented**: I focus on metrics that drive business decisions
- **Continuous Learning**: Always seeking to improve my craft

## Why Proton

I'm drawn to Proton because:

1. **Mission Alignment**: I believe in privacy as a human right, not a luxury
2. **Technical Excellence**: Opportunity to work with world-class engineering talent
3. **Real Impact**: Supporting 100M+ users who depend on secure communications
4. **Challenging Problems**: Complex payment flows across global markets with privacy constraints
5. **Growth Trajectory**: Joining a profitable, bootstrapped company building the future of the internet
